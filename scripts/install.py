'''
  This script is designed to "install" your Remote Script to Ableton Live.
  Essentally all that is to move the folder names 'src' to the appropriate
  location on your computer for Live to recognize and compile it to be
  used in a Live set.

  Once this script has run, start or restart Ableton and your Remote Script
  should be available to you in your Midi preferences as one of the options
  for a control surface. This process will have to be run again when you
  have made changes in your code to see those changes in your control surface.

  This script only works for Live 11 because it relocates the folder to the
  User Library. If your User Library is in a different location than the
  standard installation you will need to either need to change the path in
  the script or pass in the path to your User Library as an argument using
  the `--path` flag. Pass in the full path, including "User Library".

  This script also takes a guess at your username for the path. If this guess
  is incorrect or there is some kind of error, try adding your username with
  the `--user` flag.

  The `--name` flag can be used if you would like the name of the output folder
  to be different than the name of the directory the project is in.

  If you have changed the name of your src folder, then it will need to be
  changed here as well.
